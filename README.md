# Frontend Mentor - Order Summary Card

![Project Preview](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## About the Project

This is a solution for the **Order Summary Card** coding challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). This platform offers realistic front-end projects to help developers enhance their coding skills through hands-on practice.

In this challenge, I aimed to replicate the provided design as accurately as possible while ensuring clean, semantic code and responsive design principles. The goal was to create an interactive and visually appealing order summary card component.

## Features

- Hover states for interactive elements to improve user experience.
- Fully responsive design, adapting seamlessly across different devices.
- Clean and organized code structure using HTML and CSS.

## Tools and Technologies

- **HTML**: For structuring content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Frontend Mentor Resources**: As a guide for design and best practices.

## Challenges and Learnings

This project helped refine my skills in structuring HTML content and applying CSS styles effectively. Working with static JPG designs sharpened my ability to make design decisions on font sizes, spacing, and overall aesthetics without detailed design files.
